Observations and Insights
According to the data and graphs generated, it is fair to say that the Capomulin and Ramicate drug Regimen had the opportunity to be tested more times than the other drugs.
There is a strong correlation between mice weight and Tumor size, meaning that overweight mice tent to develop bigger Tumors.
Capomulin Drug regimen seems to be the more prominent drug for tumor treatment in mice, in the boxplot graph we can observe that the data for this drug doesnâ€™t have any outliers and behaves normally.
Even though Capomulin Drug was the regimen showing better results, it is necessary to compare it with the placebo treatment as well as keep track of the starting and ending tumor size across all the different treatments so we can know exactly in what percentage could the tumors be reduced over certain period.
